    Help identify and log issues during EC poking, fan control, or compatibility testing

    Assist in solving issues step by step while preserving logs

    Update the README.md and docs/*.md with completed work and clearly mark what's next

ðŸ“’ DEBUGGING RULES

    All test logs (errors, EC addresses tested, responses) go in logs/YYYY-MM-DD_<task>.log

    Any fan-related EC register discovery attempts must include:

        EC write offset

        Value written

        Response (fan movement, rpm readback)

        System temp state (CPU/GPU load condition)

    Logs must be timestamped and summarized at the top of the file like:

        # SUMMARY: Attempted fan2 EC poke, success at 0x02B1
        # Result: RPM increased under stress, reversible write confirmed.
        # Next: Isolate if fan is GPU or VRM using GPU-only stress

    âœ… COMPLETION RULES

        When a fan, sensor, or feature is confirmed working, immediately:

            Update README.md status matrix (âœ…)

            Create or update model doc in docs/<model>.md (add EC mapping)

            Append to CHANGELOG.md with date and short description

        Mark related issues as closed (if using GitHub Issues) and reference the solved commit/PR or log line

    ðŸ§­ WHATâ€™S NEXT TRACKING

        Maintain a NEXT.md file (or use README footer) with:

            Unsolved EC regions

            RPM registers still unknown

            Fans with erratic behavior or missing control

            High-priority BIOS/version tests needed
            Example:

        ## ðŸ”§ Next Targets (as of 2025-06-24)
        - [ ] Test 0x02BE and 0x02C0 EC writes for rear fan PWM control
        - [ ] Investigate EC 0x68 as possible RPM feedback from GPU fan
        - [ ] Add `alienfan.service` support for multi-pwm detection

    ðŸ’¬ COLLABORATION & COMMENT RULES

        When unsure whether a register is valid, write a NOTE: line into the log like:

        NOTE: 0x02BA might be reverse logic fan control. Needs further testing.

        If BIOS interferes with writes, log it under a [BIOS BLOCKED] section with observed behavior.

    ðŸ§ª EXPERIMENTATION TRACKING

        Every experimental test or EC scan should be saved under:

        experimental/YYYY-MM-DD_<test_name>.md

        Include:

            What was tested

            Commands used

            Output logs

            Verdict: [Success | No Effect | BIOS Blocked | Needs Retry]

    ðŸ§  FINAL RULE

        Always ask: "Did we prove it? Can someone else repeat this from scratch?"
